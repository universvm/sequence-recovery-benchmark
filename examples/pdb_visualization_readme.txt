To show prediction accuracy and entropy, open frame_model_1a41A.pdb with PyMol and run:
cartoon putty
spectrum q, blue_white_red, maximum=6,minimum=-6

Dark red indicates correct predictions,red shades indicate substitutions with positive blossum62 score, white=0, blue shades show substiutions with negative scores.
Thickness shows entropy.
